A checkers game coded entirely in python, making use of the system and pygame packages. It makes use of object-oriented programming to handle the pieces and the squares of the board, with useful custom functions that handle the piece movement, capture and promotion.
The game can be played with two players, recognising at the end which player is victorious, even allowing to be played again without needing the restart the script.
